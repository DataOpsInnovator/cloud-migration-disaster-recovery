## 📌 Overview

Cloud migrations and disaster recovery are critical components of any modern IT strategy. This project is designed to help organizations:

- Migrate on-premises workloads to the cloud.
- Design and implement disaster recovery plans.
- Test and validate DR procedures.
- Automate deployments with infrastructure as code (IaC).

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Cloud migration strategy documentation (lift-and-shift, replatform, refactor)
- ✅ Disaster recovery automation with scripts and templates
- ✅ IaC using Terraform/CloudFormation
- ✅ Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- ✅ RTO/RPO calculation tools
- ✅ Simulated DR testing workflows
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting integration examples
